The **Makerere University Cassava Image Dataset** was created to provide an open and accessible cassava dataset with well-labeled, sufficiently curated, and prepared cassava crop imagery. Data scientists, researchers, and the broader machine learning community can use the dataset for various machine learning experiments to build cassava crop disease diagnosis and spatial analysis solutions.

## Motivation

Previous cassava image datasets encountered challenges such as mislabeling of classes and limited applicability in real-world agricultural settings due to their origin in laboratory settings. Recognizing the necessity for a high-quality, accurately labeled cassava image dataset reflecting diverse crop conditions—both healthy and diseased—and captured in authentic farmer gardens, efforts were made to address this gap. The current landscape of data collection and crop pest and disease diagnosis is shifting from reliance on visible symptoms to the adoption of data-driven solutions utilizing machine learning and computer vision techniques.

Smallholder farmers and agricultural experts now utilize mobile phones equipped with software to automatically gather field-level geo-coded and time-stamped data. Despite these advancements, the previously collected image data lacks comprehensive curation and has not been effectively shared with the broader machine learning community. The dataset was created by scientists from the Makerere Artificial Intelligence Lab and the National Crops Resources Research Institute (NaCRRI) in Namulonge, Uganda. NaCRRI is an institute of the National Agricultural Research Organisation (NARO) in charge of crop research.

## Dataset Creation

The dataset encompasses various instances captured in the Central, Eastern, Northern, and Western regions of Uganda. A subset of samples was specifically collected from prominent cassava-growing districts within these regions, as chosen by agricultural experts, aiming to construct a comprehensive and representative dataset. Although the initial intention was to ensure an equal representation from each region, logistical constraints emerged, leading to a variation in district visits by the authors.

This deviation from the original plan occurred because certain regions were visited less frequently. This discrepancy arose due to the scarcity of data in some districts, either because they were predominantly urban centers or experienced minimal disease incidence owing to seasonal variations. The given labels per image are: ***healthy***, Cassava Mosaic Disease(***cmd***) and Cassava Brown Streak Disease(***cbsd***).

In the data collected in May 2021, certain instances lack the precise name of the local cassava variety, and in such cases, they were categorized as "local." This classification was necessary because agricultural experts faced challenges in accurately determining the specific cassava variety. Notably, data collected before May 2021 lacks information on age and variety, as these details were not part of the data collection requirements during that period. There are no relationships between the different image instances in the dataset.

## Collection Process

The Cassava image data was collected using mobile phones from farmer gardens. The gardens were identified within the different cassava growing prominent districts across the four regions in Uganda.For some of the data instances, the location attribute was generated by analyzing the GPS coordinate to identify the sub county. The images were taken with Android smartphones equipped with a form-based application supported by ODK1. Collaborating closely with agricultural experts in the domain, the data collection forms were meticulously designed, validated, and tested to accurately represent and capture the relevant attributes within the application. Sample data collection activities were carried out to validate and refine the data collection forms, and in-built validations were implemented to enhance data quality. These validations encompassed type validation for specific attributes, such as numbers, mandatory field requirements, and the utilization of predefined values for disease selection.

To facilitate seamless tracking and error containment, a distinct account was established for each data collector. The data collection process employed the Adsurv mobile application, a software program equipped with a module that facilitates the crowdsourcing of crop disease surveillance data directly from farmers' gardens. The Adsurv application was installed on mobile phones and tablets utilized during the data collection phase.

Individuals involved in the data collection process included a team of researchers from the Makerere Artificial Intelligence Lab, an agricultural expert affiliated with the cereals program at the National Crops Resources Research Institute (NaCRRI), and a district agricultural officer.

Cleaning of the data was done after data collection to rectify some errors that were created during collection. This included visually checking for images to ensure that they all showed the objects of interest which are the cassava leaves and all other unrelated objects were discarded. Verification of the variety names was also done and some of the variety names were corrected to reflect the correct and consistent spellings through consultation with the agricultural experts at the Namulonge Agricultural Research Institute.
