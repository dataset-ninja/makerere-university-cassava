**Makerere University Cassava Image Dataset** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the agricultural industry. 

The dataset consists of 9103 images with 3152 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*cassava brown streak disease*).

Images in the Makerere University Cassava dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 6110 (67% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 3 health statuses: ***cmd*** (4987 images), ***cbsd*** (2997 images), and ***healthy*** (1119 images). The dataset was released in 2022 by the University of Ghana.
